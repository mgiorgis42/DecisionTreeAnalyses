# DecisionTreeAnalyses
## This project comprises of two decision tree models, using two different datasets. The first analysis is more-so, a warm-up. The second analysis is the exercise. The purpose is to better understand the value decision trees bring to certain problems.

#### Disclaimer: Both datasets are open-source datasets that are either completely simulated or publicly available.
